==== A2 phase I marking ====

Group number: group_0096
UTORID usernames of members: pate1101, patelt26, santhos7, shaiskan
Total deductions:11
Grade:D-

Your team's Phase II grade is based on this scale:

    https://transcripts.utoronto.ca/faqs/grade-scale/
When converting from letter grade to numerical grade, we will use the higher end of the letter grade to convert your mark.
--For example, the higher end of A+ is 100.
--For example, the higher end of A is 89.
.
.
.
In the event that you get a F, your conversion from letter grade to numerical grade will be based on the discretion of the instructor. 

The way we graded is as follows: your team starts with an A+. When errors and
problems are found, you will lose 0, 1, 2, or 3 letter steps, depending on the
severity. As an example, if you lost two steps, your team would earn an A-:

     A+ -> A
     A -> A-

You were asked to follow the Scrum process. A big part of that is to maintain
a product backlog and a sprint backlog. 

==== Product and Sprint backlogs ==== [up to -6]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  No evidence of Product or Sprint backlog -6
- [ ]  No evidence of team assigning tasks to team members -3
- [ ]  SB items not taken directly from PB -1
- [ ]  SB items not broken down into smaller steps -1
- [ ]  PB, SB uses noticeably bad grammar and/or spelling -2

[Total deductions in this section: 0]

==== Java Style ==== [up to -6]

Steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [X] Java naming conventions not followed (camelCase, no_underscores) -1
- [ ] Instance variable names not meaningful (e.g., "Label1" is not a good name) -1
- [X] Bad indentation -1
- [ ] Lack of consistency in style across files -1
- [ ] Bad use of whitespace: too much or too little -1
- [ ] Class names are frequently not noun phrases -1
- [ ] Method names are frequently not verb phrases -1
- [ ] Not following the 80character column width limit. -1

TA COMMENTS: 
1) Bad indentation in Mkdir.
2) fix_arguments should be named as fixArguments. count_arrows should be named as countArrows.

==== Design ==== [up to -6]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [ ]  public instance variables instead of setters and getters -1 to -2
- [ ]  not a good breakdown of classes and methods (everything static;) -1
- [ ]  long methods exist (more than roughly 30 lines from brace to brace) -1
- [ ]  hard to add new commands -1
- [ ]  no unified path handling mechanism -2
- [X]  redirection doesn't easily incorporate new commands -2

TA COMMENTS: 
1) Redirection doesn't easily incorporate new commands. Consider in the future if you were asked to add redirection to Cat. A good way to resolve this
is by making a superclass (maybe an interface) for commands to inherit off of.

==== Javadoc ==== [up to -3]

Several steps can be lost for these kinds of issues:

- [X]  Missing Javadoc on methods -1 for infrequent problems, up to -3 for frequent

- [ ]  Each missing/incomplete feature -1
