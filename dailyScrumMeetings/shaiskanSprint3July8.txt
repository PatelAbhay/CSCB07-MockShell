What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Went through and revised all error checking for mkdir, ls, pop and push
    - Create test case function for mkdir, ls, pop and push
    - Revised all function to ensure they followed style guidelines
    - Thoroughly tested the entire shell to find bugs
    - Changed CommandHandler to work using an interface instead of Dictionary (Shawn assisted me as well)
    - Fixed any remaining bugs within code, and added error checking
    - Made fixes to CRC cards to reflect current design

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Nothing :)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nothing :)
