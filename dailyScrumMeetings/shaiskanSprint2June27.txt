What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Added methods to file system that would help directory and other commands
    - Finished mkdir
    - Working on ls, finished a portion of it

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Test the completed command thoroghly to ensure no bugs
`   - Finish the Push and Pop classes
    - Add an arraylist in filesystem class to keep track of push and pop stack of directories.
