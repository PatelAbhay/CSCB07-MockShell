What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished mkdir with absolute and relative paths
    - Finished ls with absolute and relative paths
    - Trouble shooted an issue with the Command class causing multiple commands at once

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Create and work on Man Class
    - Go through existing classes I've worked on to error check
    - Modify CRC cards to reflect current code

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I need a team member to make a function in Cd to verify if a path is valid before I do error checks, not a big issue
