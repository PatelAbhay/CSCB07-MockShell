What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Added error checking to mkdir
    - Added error checking to ls
    - Created man class and hashtable

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Test commands I've worked on throughly
    - Change command class to use hashtable to run commands instead of switch case
    - Error check pushd and popd, very minor addition

Am I blocked on anything?
    - A team member needs to create the Error class and hashtable, so I can add my errors to the hashtable and call it when there are errors
