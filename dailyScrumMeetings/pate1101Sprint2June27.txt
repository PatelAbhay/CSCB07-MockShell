a) What did I work on in the last three days?
	- worked on implementing the echo commands (echo append and overwrite)
	- finished function that creates different files using echo command
	- finished echo append when working with relative path
	- finished echo overwrite when working with relative path 

b) What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- finish echo append so it works when given absolute path
	- finish echo overwrite so it works when given absolute path

c) Am I blocked on anything?
	- need to brainstorm of ways to differentiate between absolute path and relative path
	- need to perform some error checks
