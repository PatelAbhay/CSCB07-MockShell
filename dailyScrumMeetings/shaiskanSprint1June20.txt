What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Created basic data structure for filesystem
    - Created filesystem class, built in a way that same instance is returned, and new filesystem classes can't be created other than 1

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Build a Command Class that routes and initializes other classes
    - Takes input from JShell class so that basic testing can be commenced by all members

Am I blocked on anything?
    - If the command class can be finished, it would let everyone test more efficently and give us a better scope of how our shell will actually function.
