What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Modified Filesystem class to be simpler and easier to interact with
    - Created Directory classes and basic starts to all of the classes.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Start cleaning up directory classes to actually perform the task, by getting user input
`   - Create the Push and Pop classes
    - Add an arraylist in filesystem class to keep track of push and pop stack of directories.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - If the command class can be finished, it would let everyone test more efficently and give us a better scope of how our shell will actually function.
